<p>Our indoor go kart racing speedway is open to the general public 7 days a week when not reserved for a private event. Whether you want to race against the clock or race against a friend there are many kart racing options to choose from. The most-popular racing format is our Arrive and Drive program that allows customers to show up individually or in small groups and race in standard races.

<h3>Full Service Indoor Kart Racing Facility Rental</h3>
<p>In addition to the adult karts (56" minimum height required) we have kid's karts for racers who are at least 48" tall and can safely drive. We also offer group events and party packages that provide private racing and reserved time slots. These packages are available in two, three and four-race formats and include items to make the occasion extra special. For larger groups Autobahn Indoor Speedway also offers full facility rentals. This has become a popular option for corporate team building events, company parties, new product launches, family reunions, and groups who want completely private racing. Additionally, full facility rentals provide guests with the opportunity to run different race formats such as Ironman, Team Endurance or Elimination races. We also have special monthly events that are open to the public. The events include Ironman Races, Team Endurance Races, Youth Racing Camps and Driving Clinics.</p>
